# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a 3D printing repository containing STL files and CAD models for aquarium-related accessories, specifically for fish keeping and breeding. The repository focuses on printable accessories rather than code.

## Project Structure

- `/coneclips/` - Contains STL files for clips that attach stainless steel washers to worm feeder cones (Lee's/Aquarium Coop compatible)
- `/augerFeederAttachment/` - Contains Fusion 360 CAD files (.f3d) for an auger-style feeder attachment compatible with Aquarium Coop and Nicrew auto feeders

## File Formats

- **STL Files** (.stl) - Ready-to-print 3D models
- **Fusion 360 Files** (.f3d) - Source CAD files that can be edited in Autodesk Fusion 360

## Hardware Requirements

For cone clips:
- 3/4" stainless steel bolt washers (1.5" OD, 0.812" ID)
- McMaster Carr part #90107A121 or equivalent

For auger feeder attachment:
- Prints in 2 pieces with no support needed
- Optional: 2x 3/8" #6 pan head screws (stainless steel recommended)

## Important Notes

- All metal hardware in contact with aquarium water must be stainless steel to prevent corrosion
- STL files are ready for direct 3D printing
- F3D files require Autodesk Fusion 360 for editing
