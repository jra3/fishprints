# Clips for weighing down feeder cones using a stainless steel washer.

Note I'm using washers for a 3/4" bolt with a 1.5" OD and a 0.812" ID. I ordered
mine from McMaster Carr. The item number is 90107A121, but you should be able to
find this at a typical hardware store as well. Make sure you are using
*stainless steel* as this is going to be in contact with your water.
